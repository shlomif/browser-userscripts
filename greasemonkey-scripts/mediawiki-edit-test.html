<h2 id="about_site">About this Site</h2>
<p>
This is the personal site of <a href="personal.html"><b>Shlomi Fish</b></a>. I
am an Israeli software developer, and writer of stories, articles, essays and
presentations.
</p>
<p>
You can explore the site using the <a href="#navbar"><b>navigation bar</b></a>
to the
left. Alternatively, you can traverse it page by page using the <b>arrows at
the top</b>. Alternatively see <a href="#news">this site's <b>news feed</b></a>
for what's new here.
</p>
<p>
Here are some of the things you can find here:
</p>
<h3 id="humour"><a href="humour/">Humour</a></h3>
<p>
I enjoy writing <a href="./humour/stories">large-scope humorous
stories</a> (novellas). My first and favourite one was
<a href="./humour/TheEnemy/">"The Enemy"</a>, which is a political
satire, inspired by mid-eastern politics, but with a more universal
message. I also wrote <a href="./humour/TOWTF/">"The One with the
Fountainhead"</a>, which is my funniest piece yet, and
<a href="./humour/human-hacking/">"The Human
Hacking Field Guide"</a>, which is a not-so-realistic realism about
open-source enthuisastic teenagers, but with many jokes.
</p>
<p>
I have other unfinished stories.
</p>
<p>
I have also written many <a href="humour/bits/">shorter bits</a> and
maintain
<a href="humour/fortunes/">a large collection of fortune cookies</a> by
myself and others.
</p>
<h3 id="philosophy"><a href="philosophy/">Articles and Essays</a></h3>
<p>
I am <a href="philosophy/politics/define-zionism/">a Jew and an Israeli</a>
by nationality, an atheist by faith, and <a
href="philosophy/philosophy/guide-to-neo-tech/">a "Neo-Tech"
Objectivist</a> by ideology. (Objectivism
<a href="./humour/fortunes/shlomif-fav.html#neo-tech-selfishness">does
not imply selfishness</a>, by the way, but rather "Rational Self-Growth".)
My expertise as a software developer (in many fields), and my interest
in philosophy, history, software management, and other fields also contribute
to my essays and articles.
</p>
<h3 id="open-source"><a href="open-source/">Open Source Software</a></h3>
<p>
Links to software I wrote, and some resources with links to other software.
Knock yourself out!
</p>
<h3 id="presentations"><a href="lecture/">Presentations</a></h3>
<p>
I prepared several technical presentations. Especially recommended is the
<a href="lecture/Perl/Newbies/">"Perl for Newbies" series</a>
introducing <a href="http://perl-begin.org/">the Perl programming
language</a> to absolute beginners.
</p>
<h3 id="links"><a href="links.html">Links</a></h3>
<p>
There are many links on the site, but I also concentrated many of them in
one place. Who doesn't like links?
</p>
<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
<p>
I hope you enjoy my web-site. If you do, please
<a href="./meta/how-to-help/">link here</a> or recommend
it to your friends.

<p class="newsitem">
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/MathVentures/two-angels-and-two-gates.html">A
    new riddle about two gates and two angels</a> was added to the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/MathVentures/">MathVentures</a> section:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="newsitem">There's a famous riddle that goes like this:</p>
<p class="newsitem">
You are standing in front of two gates (a left one and a right one) - one leads
to paradise and the other leads to hell. You don't know which gate leads where.
Besides the gates, there are two angels: one of them always tells the truth and
the other always lies, but you also don't know which one is which.
</p>
<p class="newsitem">
You have one question to ask one of the angels, in order to find out which gate
you should follow. What would that question be?
</p>

<h3 class="newsitem">05-Aug-2008: Presenetation Sources, Interviews and updated Resources</h3>
<p class="newsitem">
In 2004, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/lkcl/">lkcl</a> wrote
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/article/814.html">an
    article on Advogato saying "Love is Golden: All Ideas Have and Always
    Will be"</a>. For a long time, I've been supplying the HTML material
for <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/">my presentations</a>
under permissive, free-content licences, but did not supply the
source code and markup used to generate them. Inspired by the article, I set
to remedy it, and now there are links from the individual presentations
to the source tarballs.
</p>
<p class="newsitem">
Note that some presentations were created using other tools, and so are
not available with their source yet, but hopefully this will be remedied soon,
too.
</p>
<p class="newsitem">
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/interviews/">The two Interviews
    with open-source people</a> were now converted to
XML-Grammar-Screenplay and their source is available on the page.
</p>
<p class="newsitem">
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/resources/software-tools/">Software
    Contruction and Management Tools page</a> was heavily updated.
</p>
<p class="newsitem">
New links have been added to
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/">the
    pages "Against Bad Software"</a>.
</p>
<p class="newsitem">
New film recommendations have been added
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/recommendations/films/">to
    the movie recommendations</a>. Moreover, two new book reviews have
been added:
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/#pragmatic_programmer">about
    "The Pragmatic Programmer"</a> and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/#extreme_programming_explained">about
    "Extreme Programming Explained"</a>.
</p>
<p class="newsitem">
New links have been added <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/links.html">to
    the links page</a>.
</p>
<p class="newsitem">
New quotes have been added <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">to
    the Fortune Cookie Collection</a>. More information is
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/#web-feed">in
    their web-feeds</a>.
</p>
<p class="newsitem">
There were also internal improvements to the site's build system making
the building of the DocBook/XML documents and other resources less
error-prone and more powerful and customisable.

    of my newest aphorisms</a> were added to

    Aphorism collection</a>:
</p>

The first revision of a new essay -
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/software-management/perfect-workplace/">"The
    Perfect IT Workplace"</a> was published. It was released
pre-maturely due to someone redditing the article, but may still
be of interest:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="newsitem"><b>The Best Tools that Money Can Buy</b></p>
<p class="newsitem">
This cannot stressed enough. As <a class="ulink" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel Spolsky notes</a> (based
on Steve McConnell) in item No. 9 of the Joel
Test, you need to "use the best tools that money can buy".
</p>
<p class="newsitem">
If you buy old, broken and/or barely functioning hardware,
you'll spend a lot of time debugging the problems there,
which will waste a lot of precious time. And you may
lose a lot of reputation and customers due to down-time.
<span class="bold"><strong>Relying on reliable, high-end
    hardware</strong></span> is a much
better idea.
</p><p class="newsitem">
I've been to two workplaces that gave me an old
computer with a 40 GB hard-disk. It wasn't enough at
all. At one place, we've reached the limit of this
hard-disk due to several large source code checkouts,
and as a result needed a bigger hard-disk. And the
only hard-disks the lab had were 80 GB ones, which were
bought because they were the cheapest (per-disk, not
per-capacity). Please, <span class="bold"><strong>buy
    large enough hard-disks</strong></span>.
</p>
<p class="newsitem">
At the same workplace, I was given a computer with a
read-only CD-ROM drive. It was not even a DVD reader.
I brought a DVD of audio files from home, and could not
read it. In this day and age, read/write DVD drives
are the standard, and are ultra-cheap.

<h3 class="newsitem">19-Jun-2008: &quot;Why Closed Books are So 19th Century?&quot;</h3>
<p class="newsitem">
The highlight of today's news item is that there's
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/closed-books-are-so-19th-century/">a new essay titled <b>"Why Closed Books are So 19th Century?"</b></a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="newsitem"> And despite all that, we can often see that books are getting published
    on paper, and either completely not available online, or their free
    re-distribution is restricted. They are often available on Peer-to-Peer
    networks or illegally, but their use is still restricted, and complicates
    things. </p>
    <p class="newsitem">
    In this article, I'd like to note why non-open books (or at least books
    that are not available online) are as pointless as <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/foss-other-beasts/">non-open-source
        software</a>.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="newsitem">
The other changes are more minor:
</p>
<ul class="newsitem">
    <li>Improvements to the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/">Recommended
        music page</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
    Added
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/conf/vim/">my
        Vim configuration files</a> to the site.
    </li>
    <li>
    There's a
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/shlomif.html#monty-python-on-computer-interfaces">new
        fortune cookie</a>.

    I often wonder why I hang out with so many people who are so pedantic. And
    then I remember - because they are so pedantic.

<p class="newsitem">
The <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/">Music
    Recommendations page</a> was updated with more links (to the Wikipedia,
